- Want to contribute? Make a pr for any feature from the [Feature Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/196sVDUJELCznO_RF7vib9-2uMkRaHFwVG9ogDHR1CBU)! 
- You can find the mod's releases on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Team-Symphony/Harmony/releases), and the full changelogs on [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/Team-Symphony/Harmony/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)
- Want to try features before a release? Try out nightly builds! https://nightly.link/Team-Symphony/Harmony/workflows/build/main?preview (You can replace "main" on the url with the name of any other branch to try a nightly build from that branch instead!)
