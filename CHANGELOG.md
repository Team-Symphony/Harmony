## Known Issues

#### Food

- Bundles not showing correct stew amount on vanilla clients ([#28](https://github.com/Team-Symphony/Harmony/issues/28))
  - Current workarounds: Install Harmony on the client or disable Stew and Soup Stacking.
- Stews and soups dont properly stack on the player's inventory while on creative mode on vanilla clients. ([#24](https://github.com/Team-Symphony/Harmony/issues/24))
    - Current workarounds: Install Harmony on the client or disable Stew and Soup Stacking (or change gamemode to another different from creative).

#### Combat

- Sometimes using /give command may create a copy of the given item that cant be picked up. This bug hasnt been able to be consistently reproduced and debugged yet.
    - Current workarounds: Disable the "Change items despawn time depending on difficulty" feature.

#### Mobs

- Parrots become invisible for vanilla clients if the player starts flying on creative mode with parrots on their shoulders until client reconnects or the parrots fly off of the player.
    - Current workaround: Install Harmony on the client or disable "Parrots dismount under fewer restrictions"
